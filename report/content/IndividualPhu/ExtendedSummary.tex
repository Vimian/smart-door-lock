%Write an Extended Summary for the individual report.
%As part of this you must highlight with one bolted point the elements from each of the 2 courses.
The case has it uses both elements from System analysis \& verification and Software Technology for the Internet of Things.
\subsubsection{\textbf{SSAV}}
I have used SSAV to model and analyze the different states that the lock can transition into and test with the model to verify my validation of how the state machine should behave for the Smart door lock.
\subsubsection{\textbf{IOT}}
I have used IoT to build the ESP32 on a breadboard to configure wires and sensors to work with GPIO pins I have predefined with the software implementation and flash it to the ESP32.
