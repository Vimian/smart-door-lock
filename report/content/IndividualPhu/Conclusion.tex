Choosing SPP/GATT works to implement a version for iPhones and Android can both use our implementation of a smart door lock with all the current features implemented, however, iPhones still have to install an app to be able to scan for the device, and it comes at a cost of minor performances and older phones may not be \gls{ble} compatible. The verification test is successful in verifying our model and thereby validates of our requirement.
