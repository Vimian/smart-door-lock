The problem being addressed is to secure the front door of a house, while still allowing those with authorization to enter, for this purpose, a smart door lock will be developed.
Since the lock will be securing a house, it requires a high level of trustworthiness.
This is achieved through verification and validation of the product.
Furthermore is there some additional requirements, such as a cellphone should be used to toggle between locked and unlocked states.
The door must open within a reasonable time, this is specified as 10 seconds.
The purpose for this is assumed, to prevent a user from initiating an unlock event, and then leaving the site due to the lock taking too long to open.
Eventually resulting in the lock completing the unlocking process, after the user has left, leaving the door unlocked.
The lock should therefore stay locked, if the unlocking timeframe is exceeded during the unlock process.
