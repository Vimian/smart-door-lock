The problem being addressed is to secure the front door of a house while still allowing those with authorization to enter, for this purpose, a smart door lock will be developed.
Since the lock will secure a house, it requires a high level of trustworthiness, which is achieved through verification and validation of the product.
Furthermore is there some additional requirements, such as a cellphone should be used to toggle between locked and unlocked.
The door must open within a reasonable time, this being 10 seconds, to prevent a user from initiating an unlock event and leaving the site due to the lock taking too long to open.
This could result in the lock completing the unlocking process after the user has left, leaving the open unlocked.
The lock should therefore stay locked if the unlocking timeframe exceeds during the unlock process.
