This report describes the development of a smart door lock.
The system is designed to secure a front door while allowing authorized users to enter.
The designed system has the ease of use for the user in mind, to make it more appealing.
The system is designed as a state machine, which is tested in UPPAAL before being converted to C code, to ensure a high level of trustworthiness.
The knowledge from the SSaV course is used to design the state machine, and automatically verify the system using the UPPAAL tool.
The knowledge from the IoT course is used to design mockup hardware for manual testing, and how to program the ESP32, such as basic C code, using Bluetooth Classic and BLE, interacting with GPIO pins (buttons and LED), and compiling and flashing the codebase.
