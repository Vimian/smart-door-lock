The solution provides the functionality of connecting with bluetooth to the ESP, if the bluetooth connection is recognized as a trusted device, it will allow the user to enter. While it is also possible to open up the door with the potentiometer in case that the bluetooth is unable to connect, the idea is that malfunctions could happen and the user would still need access to their house and or belongings. If it were the case that non of the intended methods to gain entry is used, the bluetooth connection and potentiometer, an alarm will be set of as it would then be considered a forced entry.
