I've made use of the Software Technology for Internet of Things (IOT) and Software System Analysis and Verification(SSAV).

\subsubsection{SSAV} I have used SSAV to model and verify the solutions and that they work logically. The \gls{2fa} system was modelled before the implementation started to ensure that there were no flaws in the logic and that it would not make any of our test fail or disrupt any of the other systems functionality.

\subsubsection{IOT} The system has been developed on esp32 as well as a IOT components. The project makes use of several APIs which is provided through the esp32.
