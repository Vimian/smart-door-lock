\subsection*{Extended Summary}
[ SSAV ] [ IOT ]
%Write an Extended Summary for the individual report.
%As part of this you must highlight with one bolted point the elements from each of the 2 courses.
I've made use of the Software Technology for Internet of Things (IOT) and Software System Analysis and Verification(SSAV).

\subsubsection{SSAV}
I have used SSAV to model and verify the solutions and that they work logically. The \gls{2fa} system was modelled before the implementation started to ensure that there were no flaws in the logic, and that it would not make any of our UPPAAL test fail or disrupt any of the other systems functionality.

\subsubsection{IOT}
The system has been developed on esp32 as well as a IOT components. The project makes use of several APIs which are provided through the esp32.

\subsubsection{Summary}
In this individual report I will be going over security features which I implemented. It includes two features where one is 2 Factor Authentication, which is used to authenticate users to protect against password breaches, which were successfully modelled using UPPAAL, implemented, and verified. The other feature is brute force attack protection, which only reached an analysis phase and never modelled in UPPAAL nor implemented.
