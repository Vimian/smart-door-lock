\newpage\subsection{Conclusion}
The project overall is a great success, we achieved more than the minimum required for our solution as well as implementing extra functionalities such as Bluetooth Low Energy. While the system did not reach all of the goals which we had for it, it achieved most of them. The only remaining features was Brute force detection and allowing multiple users at once. The solution did fulfil all of the expectations the group had for the project as well as fulfilling all requirements. The system did behave like the system modelled in UPPAAL and did prove to be able as a logically verify solution.
