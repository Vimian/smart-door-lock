\subsection{Conclusion}
The project overall is a great success, we achieved more than minimum required for our solution as well as implementing extra functionalities such as Bluetooth Low Energy, and start of Brute force attack detection. While the system did not reach all of the goals which we had for it, it achieved most of them and nearly all of the goals. The only remaining features was Brute force detection and allowing multiple users at once. The solution did fulfil all of the exceptions the group had for the project as well as fulfilling all requirements. The system did behave like the system modelled in UPPAAL and did prove to be able logically verify a solution.
