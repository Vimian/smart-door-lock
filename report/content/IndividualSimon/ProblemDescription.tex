A problem with the solution out of the box is that it lacks security measures. Bluetooth comes with some security features but it is lacking. What bluetooth provides is depending on which implementation, is the ability to recognize phone units and accept new users if they know the password. If an intruder were to guess the password, they would have full access. Another risk is an attackers bruteforcing phone ID's to gain access. Phone ID  could be compared to fingerprints, the problem is that there is a risk of some have the same ID like with fingerprints. An intruder could potentially attempt to guess this ID, most likely using a method of brute forcing. Two security features will mitigate this security flaw.
