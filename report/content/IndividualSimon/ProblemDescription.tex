A problem with Bluetooth is that it lacks security measures which our system needs. Bluetooth comes with some security features but it is lacking. What Bluetooth provides is depends on which implementation, it has the ability to recognize phone units and accept new users if they know the password. But if an intruder were to guess the password they would have full access to the users property. Another risk is if an attackers is brute-forcing phone ID's to gain access. Phone ID  could be compared to fingerprints, the problem is that there is a risk of someone having the same ID like with fingerprints. An intruder could potentially attempt to guess this ID, most likely using a method of brute forcing. Two security features will mitigate these security flaws.
