\subsection*{Extended Summary}
[ SSaV ] [ MDSD ] [ IoT ] 
\newline
%Write an Extended Summary for the individual report.
%As part of this you must highlight with one bolted point the elements from each of the 2 courses.

The contribution of this individual report is the implementation of the state machine, Bluetooth Classic and the hardware for the mock-up.
The state machine was made by all group members in UPPAAL, with the knowledge from the course SSaV.
I did later implement the state machine in C code.
The knowledge of how to implement a state machine in a programming language is from the course MDSD.
The knowledge about how to code C for the state machine and interact with the Bluetooth hardware and GPIO pins, is from the course IoT. Also learned from IoT was how to go about designing a circuit for the hardware of the mock-up.
