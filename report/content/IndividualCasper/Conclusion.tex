\subsection{Conclusion}
%Short conclusion summarizing the project, achieved solution and results.

Implementation of the state machine in C code was straight forward using the UPPAAL models since all choices regarding the logic were already made.
It was also nice to know that the implementation should theoretically work, since the UPPAAL models were tested and proven to work.
Working with Bluetooth did I implement the logic from scratch, and from the test and achivement of opening within fare less than 10 seconds, does it seem to be effective.
The mock-up was also a success since it was able to show the different states of the system, giving a visual representation of the system's state.
