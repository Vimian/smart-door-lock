%Provide a more detailed problem description here. What is the problem about? Characterize the problem in a way that allows for deriving a solution.

The problem is to implement a state machine in C code, so it can be run on the ESP32.
The other problem is to interact with the Bluetooth hardware of the ESP32 through code.

There are some requirements for the system which limits the solutions to these problems.
One of these being that the system must have a high level of trustworthiness, and must therefore act like the state machine in UPPAAL, which is proven to work by our tests.
Implementing a state machine in code does not give anything functionality by itself.
An interpreter is needed to run the state machine.
% add something about the different states in the state machine

The Bluetooth hardware of the ESP32 is not easily accessible from the C code.
There had to be made some configurations and logic, to interact with the Bluetooth hardware.
